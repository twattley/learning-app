# Recall — Product Overview

> "Flashcards on steroids" — a personal learning app that uses AI and spaced repetition to fight the forgetting curve.

## What Is It?

Recall is a personal learning application for a single user. It combines two activities: **curating study material** and **consuming it through active recall**. The user adds questions across any topic, and the app uses LLM-powered feedback and spaced repetition to turn rough notes into structured, permanent knowledge.

This is not a multi-user SaaS product. It's a personal tool — scale, auth, and multi-tenancy are not concerns.

## The Problem It Solves

You learn things and forget them. You read about TCP, practice a Poisson distribution problem, study present value calculations — and a week later it's gone. Recall fixes this by:

1. Making it easy to capture what you're learning (even rough notes)
2. Scheduling reviews at the optimal time to prevent forgetting (spaced repetition)
3. Using AI to give feedback on recall attempts so you learn from mistakes
4. Mixing different topics randomly so you can't just coast on pattern recognition (interleaving)

## Core Features

### 1. Question Management (Curation)

Users create flashcard-style questions and answers across any topic — programming, statistics, finance, networking, anything.

- **Create/edit/delete** questions with topic tags
- **Markdown support** for rich formatting (code blocks, lists, etc.)
- **Refine with Gemini** — type rough notes and let AI polish them into comprehensive, accurate study material
  - The key insight: a refined reference answer means even a simple/small model can grade accurately later
  - Intelligence is front-loaded at creation time; grading becomes mechanical comparison
- **Topic filtering** to browse and manage by subject area

### 2. Learning Interface (Active Recall)

The main screen. A question appears, you answer from memory, and you get feedback.

- **Random interleaving** — regular Q&A and math problems are mixed randomly for optimal learning
- **Question rephrasing** — optionally, questions are subtly reworded each time so you can't just memorise the phrasing
- **LLM-graded feedback** — your answer is compared against the reference answer and scored 1-5, with:
  - A verdict (one-line summary)
  - What you missed (bullet points)
  - An actionable learning tip
- **Spaced repetition (SM-2)** — scores drive when you'll see the question again:
  - Got it? See it in days/weeks
  - Struggled? See it again in 10 minutes
  - The system adapts per-question based on your history

### 3. Dynamic Math Problems

Template-based math problems with parameters randomised each time and word problems generated by AI.

**Probability:**

- Poisson distribution (PMF, CDF, survival)
- Binomial distribution (PMF, CDF)
- Normal distribution (CDF, z-score)
- Exponential distribution (CDF, survival)

**Finance:**

- Present value
- Future value
- Compound interest

Key details:

- **Parameters are randomised** — you never see the same numbers twice
- **Word problems are LLM-generated** — creative, realistic scenarios (not "calculate P(X=3)")
- **Correct answers computed via scipy** — no risk of AI hallucinating the maths
- **Formula hints available** — "Show Hint" reveals the formula without giving the answer
- **In-app calculator** — expression evaluator (supports factorial, exp, sqrt, etc.)
- **Spaced repetition at the template level** — if you keep getting Poisson CDF wrong, you'll see more of those

### 4. Multi-Platform Access

- **Web app** — primary interface, clean dark UI
- **Mobile app** — React Native via Expo, same core features
- **Configurable API endpoint** — mobile connects to the backend via Tailscale (settings page to configure)

## Learning Science Principles

The app is built around established learning research:

- **Spaced repetition** — review at increasing intervals to move knowledge into long-term memory
- **Interleaving** — mixing different question types/topics forces deeper processing vs. blocked practice
- **Active recall** — answering from memory is more effective than re-reading
- **Desirable difficulty** — rephrased questions prevent shallow memorisation

## LLM Strategy

The app uses a flexible LLM architecture:

- **Gemini (cloud)** — used for math word problem generation, Q&A refinement, and math feedback. High quality matters here and it's infrequent.
- **Ollama (local)** — used for regular Q&A grading. Runs on a Mac Mini. Good enough for grading against rich reference material.
- **Designed for swappability** — comprehensive reference answers mean even tiny models could grade accurately. Opens the door to on-device models in future.

## User Experience Flow

### Adding a Question

1. Enter topic, rough question, rough answer
2. Optionally click "Refine with Gemini" to polish into comprehensive study material
3. Save — stored with spaced repetition metadata, due immediately for first review

### Learning Session

1. Open the app → a question appears (could be Q&A or math)
2. Answer from memory (text for Q&A, number for math)
3. For math: use the calculator and/or hints if needed
4. Submit → get LLM feedback with score
5. Click "Next" → another randomly interleaved question
6. Questions you struggle with appear more frequently

## Infrastructure

- Single user, single deployment
- Backend runs on a Mac Mini at home
- Mobile connects via Tailscale VPN
- All data in one database
- No auth needed — it's a personal tool on a private network

## Future Considerations (Not Yet Built)

- On-device LLM for phone-only mode (offline grading)
- More math template types (combinatorics, calculus, etc.)
- Statistics dashboard (streak, mastery per topic)
- Import/export questions
- LLM-generated question suggestions based on topic
